# BubbleSort

Objective:

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).

Loop through Array the first time
If left element is greater than right element, swap elements and continue
Check if array is properly sorted
If not, continue with subsequent iterations until array is fully sorted
